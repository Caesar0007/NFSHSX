/* syslib/psx/libpad/WAITRC2.cpp -- RECONSTRUCTED from nfs4-f.exe (disasm-v3 authoritative).
 *   obj libpad.lib(WAITRC2.OBJ): the root-counter-2 (Timer 2) busy-wait helpers used throughout the
 *   SIO0 controller protocol (PADMAIN/PADCMD).  setRC2wait arms a wait of N timer ticks; chkRC2wait
 *   reports whether that wait has elapsed yet, accounting for the 16-bit counter wrapping and the
 *   /8 prescale.  Ghidra decompiled chkRC2wait as an empty `void` -- it is NOT: it returns a BOOL
 *   (1 = expired, 0 = still waiting), confirmed by the `slt; xori 1` at its tail and by every caller
 *   doing `while (chkRC2wait() == 0)`. */
